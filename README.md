# Ironhack Data Analytics Katas

## Getting Started

0. Only the first time: Clone this repository into your `ironhack/katas` folder:

1. 🚨 **Before starting** a new assignment 🚨: 

````
git status
``````
1.1 🚨 **Check if you are located at the main branch** 🚨

If not, please switch to main branch.

1.2 🚨 **If you are located in a local brach and you have uncommited changes:** 🚨 Please, execute ````git add . ```` ➡️ ````git commit -m "uncommited changes"```` ➡️````git push```` ➡️ ````git checkout main````

1.3 🚨 **Check if you are now at the MAIN branch** 🚨: 

````
git status
``````

````
git pull origin main
``````

2. Once you're into the katas project folder you can create a new branch to start a new assignment:

```
$ git checkout -b <kata_name-my_name>
```
Example:  ```git checkout -b kata-vowel-count-victor```

You can save your regularly using:

```
$ git add <files-to-add>
$ git commit -m "lab-started"
$ git push origin <branch-name>
```

After you finish, perform a last commit as follow:

```
$ git add <files-to-add>
$ git commit -m "kata-finished"
$ git push origin <branch-name>
```
3. 🚨 Finally **open a Pull Request** 🚨: 


```
your branch -> main
```

```
kata example [victor galan]
```

The teaching team will review your branch and will merge the winner one.

**To work on the subsequent assignments**, create a new branch for every new assignment.

### Happy coding!
